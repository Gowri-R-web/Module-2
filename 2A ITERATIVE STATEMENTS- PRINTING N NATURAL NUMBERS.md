## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ PRINTING NUMBERS RANGE FROM M TO N(INCLUDING M AND N VALUES)
###  Aim
To create a Python program for printing numbers range from M to N

---

###  Algorithm

1. Begin the program.
2. Ask the user to enter the starting number M.
3. Ask the user to enter the ending number N.
4. Begin from M and go up to N.
5. For each number in this range, print the number.
6. Stop when N is reached.
7. Terminate the program.

### ðŸ§¾ Program

```python
# 212223060073
# Gowri Sankari R

m=int(input())
n=int(input())

for i in range(m,n+1):
    print(i)

```
